< Workshop >

I was stuck for a long time on a function that I didn't think was broken.
My focus is always on other functions that I find more difficult. 

Like:
    virtual std::ostream& display(std::ostream& ostr = std::cout) const;
    virtual std::istream& read(std::istream& istr = std::cin);

And during the bug fixing process, I never thought there was an issue with the function.
I've encountered this experience many times in my learning of CPP, and it's really frustrating.

In the beginningï¼š
    FullName::operator bool() const {
        return !m_lastname && !Name::getName();
    }

For now:
    FullName::operator bool() const {
        return m_lastname && Name::getName();
    }
