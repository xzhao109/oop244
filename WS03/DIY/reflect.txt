Part1 - Army module 
in updateUnits():
She helped me to figure out the formula for calculating units and power.
I appreciate her help.

For this workshop, the biggest feeling is that I must read the guide carefully 
to figure out what the project is going to do, what functions each module is going to accomplish, 
and how to cooperate with each other. 

I wrote the requirements for each variable and function in the comments, 
and reading the comments repeatedly helped me a lot to finish the workshop.

I think it is very important to fully understand the concept of C++, 
followed by understanding the modules, the role of each function, and how they work with each other.

There are some difficult points about this workshop, as follows:

Part1 - Army module 
in updateUnits():
Maria helped me to figure it out.

Part2 - BarChart module 
I spent a lot of time thinking about how the two modules would work. 

in allValid():

didn't workï¼š
    if (counter == sizeOfBars)
    {
        bool ok = true;
    }
worked:
    if (counter == sizeOfBars)
    {
        ok = true;
    }

I duplicated the declaration of two bool variables, so it never succeeded in returning a value,
resulting in an error in draw(), and it took me a long time to find the issue.
