I was able to understand how add_chapter() with her help.

add_chapter();
    I struggled with this feature for a long time, 
    and at first I didn't understand why I had to do it. 
    I later realized why I had to do it.

operator double()；
    It is not possible to cast directly the result of dividing two numbers, 
    but only to cast them individually or separately to succeed.

Hero(3 args);
    In the beginning, it was difficult for me to understand what this constructor does. 
    It took me a long time to understand, 
    and I always wanted to use the assignment operator to copy the power to hero. 
    My next thought was to use the dumb method (the old workshop method), 
    initializing all the values and assigning them before adding the new data.


maxtrix error:
display();
    When I submitted the matrix, I got an error stating ‘os’ was out of scope, 
    but adding ‘os = std::cout’ resolved the issue.
    std::ostream& display(std::ostream& os = std::cout) const;

Invalid write of size 8:
set_powerlist();
m_powerlist = new Power[m_num_powers];
    When I allocated the memory, I only had enough places to store data, 
    and then +1 solved the issue.
    m_powerlist = new Power[m_num_powers + 1];


Operator overloading is difficult for me, 
especially when calling multiple modules at the same time.
