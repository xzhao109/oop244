For the ms2 part, the more difficult function is run(). 
I spent a long time trying to fix this function and finally solved the problem with if-else. 
Despite the hints in the documentation, 
but I insisted on using switch statement and tried for a long time.

    LibApp::void run();

This is also a mistake I often made in the past; 
that is, I did not figure out what exactly I wanted to do, and then I rushed to do itï¼Œ
and ended up wasting a lot of time.

The complicated part of the workshop is to understand how to properly 
call the functions of the base class. 

    bool Account::credit(double);
    bool Account::debit(double);
    void ChequingAccount::monthEnd();
