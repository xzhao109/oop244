< /Part1 - Lab>
The hardest part of this section feels like an understanding of file I/O. 
ofstream is used for writing files, while ifstream is used for reading files.
Once I understand this, numCount(), load(), etc. will be easier to understand.

numberCount()/load():
    At the beginning, I was confused about how to check whether the file had successfully opened 
    and how to read the newline character, but then I tried to figure out the if conditions and get()
    to determine whether the file was successfully opened and how many records were in the file. 

operator+=():

    This was also a bit hard to understand at the beginning. 

    The main idea is:
    First create a temporary object, then save the data of the current object into the temporary object.
    Then add the new data to the temporary object, and finally delete the original object.
    Copy the object with the new data added to the original object.
    and then return the latest object (with the newly added data). 

    This way, the original object has a new address and new data. 
    This is also, I think, one of the most difficult functions.



< /Part2 - DIY>
    I think the difficulty is simpler than in Part 1.
    This is mainly the synthesis of all the previous workshops.
