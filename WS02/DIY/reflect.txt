This is my first time writing a reflection. I'm both happy and sad.

The first lecture of the first week of this semester made me feel like C++ was hard. 
Fortunately, I haven't given up yet. 
I finally digested the knowledge in the first two weeks after watching many videos and reading articles.

I appreciate your help, professor. 
After I spoke to you on the call last time, it helped me a lot.
Thank you again.
